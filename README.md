To replicate the results in the paper, please run the colab notebook in a TPU environment. For replication of a single experimental run, using a single colab TPU environment is sufficient. For replciation of all the runs in the paper, it will take approximately two weeks using 5 TPUs in parallel.

You can view the read only version of the notebook in this https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1voh8MylBQYari3cWmTE593bKrBsp1uWI?usp=sharing. You can then copy the notebook for your own use and make edits or run the notebook.
